# NodeJS for Front-End Developers

This repository contains the Notes, Schedule, Slides and a completed set of codealongs for a workshop intended to help front-end developers learn how to use NodeJS.

The Codealongs are in the `code` folder, in case you took this workshop and want to see some solutions.

The slides are in `slides.html`, and there are detailed notes in `Notes.md`.

If you're going to use this slideshow to teach your own workshop, please feel free, but a little note at the end about where you got it would be appreciated :)

Pull requests to improve it would be greatly appreciated, too.

Happy coding!
