* Sending Emails
* Embedding Tweets

---

## Review: Transitions

## Transition Syntax

```css
transition: [transition-property] [transition-duration] [transition-timing-function] [transition-delay];
```

* `transition-property`: A CSS property such as `color` or `width`
* `transition-duration`: A duration in seconds such as 1s or 0.5s
* `transition-timing-function`: The timing function, such as `linear` or `ease-out`
* `transition-delay`: The delay before the transition begins, also in seconds

---

## Transitions: Multiple Effects Example


.left-column-75[
```css
a {
  display: block;
  background-color: green;
  height: 100px;
  color:white;
  transition: background-color 0.5s linear, height 1.5s linear;
}

a:hover {
  background-color: red;
  height: 300px;
}
```
]

.right-column-25[
<a href="#" class="trans-multiple-ex">Hover over me!</a>
]
<style type="text/css">
a.trans-multiple-ex {
  display: block;
  background-color: green;
  height: 100px;
  color:white;
  transition: background-color 0.5s linear, height 1.5s linear;
}

a.trans-multiple-ex:hover {
  background-color: red;
  height: 300px;
}
</style>

---

## Transitions: Timing Functions Example


.left-column[
```css
a {
  display: block;
  background-color: blue;
  height: 100px;
  color:white;
  transition: height 4.5s ease-in;
  /* On the right it's */
  /* "height 4.5s linear" */
}

a:hover {
  height: 500px;
}
```
]

.right-column[
<div class="trans-timing-ex-2">
  <a href="#" class="easein">I'm easing in</a>
  <a href="#" class="lin">I'm linear</a>
</div>
]
<style type="text/css">
.trans-timing-ex-2 a {
  display: inline-block;
  background-color: blue;
  height:100px;
  width:200px;
  color:white;
  float:left;
  text-align: center;
  margin:0 20px;
}

.trans-timing-ex-2 a.lin {
  transition: height 4.5s linear;
}
.trans-timing-ex-2 a.easein {
  transition: height 4.5s ease-in;
}

.trans-timing-ex-2:hover a {
  height: 500px;
}
</style>

## Review: Google Maps

* The Google Maps JavaScript API is a simple way to interact with the Google Maps service via JavaScript
* The API is highly performant and very well documented<br>https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/
* We can mash the API up with other services to create infographics, or simply add markers to a map for contact details
* To add the API to your HTML:<br>`<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js"></script>`

# JSON
## JavaScript Object Notation

---

## JSON

* JavaScript Object Notation
* We have touched on this in previous lessons with `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`
* Pronounced "Jason"
* Devised by noted JavaScript master Douglas Crockford
* Format for transmitting data structures in a platform-agnostic way between a server and a web application
* JSON looks a lot like a JavaScript object... but more stringy!

---

## JSON: Why?

* It’s the most common format for data interchange on the web
* Most public APIs will emit their data in JSON (Twitter, Google, Facebook, Reddit, etc)
* The older formats like XML are difficult and time-consuming to parse
* Your web browser can transparently turn a JSON response from a web API into a JavaScript object

---

.left-column[
## JavaScript Object
```js
{
  make : "Tesla",
  model : "Model S",
  year : 2013,
  features : [
    'Electric',
    'Shiny',
    'Awesome'
  ]
}
```
]

.right-column[
## JSON
```json
{
  "make" : "Tesla",
  "model" : "Model S",
  "year" : 2013,
  "features" : [
    "Electric",
    "Shiny",
    "Awesome"
  ]
}
```
]

.important[
The same, only stringier!
]

---

## Tools

* JSONView for Google Chrome lets you view prettified JSON in your browser<br>http://bit.ly/1hvTe0r
* JSONLint is a web app for validating your JSON is valid – much like JSHint for JavaScript.<br>http://jsonlint.com/
* Your browser can "stringify" a JavaScript object into a JSON string and vice-versa

.left-column[
```javascript
JSON.stringify({
  make : "Tesla",
  model : "Model S"
});
```
* This is also known as "encoding"
]

.right-column[
```javascript
JSON.parse('{ "make" : "Tesla", "model" : "Model S" }');
```
* This is also known as "decoding"
]

## JSON: Remember

* The data you will get back from web APIs (which we'll discuss in a minute) will often be encoded as JSON, so you will need to `JSON.parse` it before you can use it in your JavaScript, some how.
* Now, where can we get some JSON...?

# Web APIs
## Application Programming Interfaces (API)

---

## Application Programming Interface (API)

* As we know, an API is what developers use to interact with a piece of software (e.g. the Google Maps API from last lesson)
* Formally, an API describes how software components interact with each other
* Conversely, a UI (**User** Interface) describes how a user talks to the software
* Your phone might provide an application developer a "camera" API, which would have methods for taking photos, downloading photos, enabling the flash and so on. The application developer therefore needn't write this code.

---

## Web APIs

* Some businesses expose their data for consumption through APIs
* Web APIs that expose data generally emit this using the JSON format
  * [BBC 6 Music (radio) Playlist JSON example](http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/playlist.json)<br>(http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/playlist.json)
* Web APIs can be used not only for consuming data, but also for exposing functionality
  * Twilio allow you to send and receive text messages and phone calls through their API
  * Reddit allow you to post new links but also list all links on a particular subject
  * Foursquare allow you to search nearby places and also register a user's presence at certain places

---

## Parsing remote JSON with jQuery

* jQuery provides some helpful methods for retrieving and parsing JSON
* `$.get(url, callback)` for fetching remote files
* `$.parseJSON(string)` to parse a JSON string into a JavaScript object<br>(the same as `JSON.parse(strong)`, but that isn't available in older browsers)
* You could do a `$.get` on a JSON file, then `$.parseJSON` on the contents
* Better yet, `$.getJSON(url, callback)` does both in one fell swoop
* Note: the remote data source must support `JSONP` or `CORS` - for now, you needn't know too much about what this means, and most will support `CORS`

---

## Web APIs

* `getJSON`'s callback function exposes a `data` object that is the JavaScript object parsed from the JSON string retrieved from the URL

```js
$.getJSON("http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/playlist.json", function (data) {
  console.log(data);
});
```

* The `data` object is just like any other object in JavaScript - or it could be an array. This you should know if you know what to expect from the website's API.

# Code-along
## My Reddit

---

## My Reddit

* In case you're not familiar with Reddit, it is a "link-sharing" website.
* Users sign up and submit, or "post" links to other locations on the web, and other users vote that they either like or dislike what the original poster shared
* You can discuss the content, start arguments with fellow Redditors or give them "gold", as a way to indicate how great their contribution was
* Links are posted to different topics, organised in "Subreddits". For example, "Movies" is a subreddit, as is "Funny", and "Aww".
* http://reddit.com
* Best of all, Reddit has an extremely open Web API which anybody can access without authentication: in other words, you can use it even without signing up!

---

## My Reddit

* We're going to try to re-create some of Reddit's website using their API, using what we've learned today.

---

## Closed APIs

* Not all organisations offer an API quite as open as Reddit's. Sometimes, access by third parties (known as client applications) is restricted.
* Some will be protected by authentication methods including standard username & password, or a more complex, more secure method of authentication called OAuth.
* Others will allow open, unauthenticated access to their data but only through the channels they provide.
* Others will only allow client applications to use the API if they provide an "API Key" which they were given when signing up.
* This is generally done to prevent misuse or overuse of the API. For many companies, it is only cost-effective for them to provide the API if they restrict the use in this way

---

## Sending Emails

* Mandrill is a web application created by the MailChimp team for sending one-off, or "transactional" emails.
* They provide an API, as well as a JavaScript "wrapper" for it, so we can more easily access the API in JavaScript.
* The only thing they require is that you have signed up on their website and created an API key

### Sign up and get an API key

1. Go to https://mandrill.com/signup/ and sign up
2. Log in at https://mandrill.com/login
3. Go to https://mandrillapp.com/settings/index and click "+ Add API Key"
4. You will be given a random string of characters which looks a bit like `E0wMT13opHfaPPUTFCkpSq` - **copy this, and paste it somewhere for later**

# Code-along
## Sending Emails with Mandrill

---

## Embedding your Tweets

* You can get deeper access to Twitter's API if you authenticate, but a common use case of Twitter's API is simply to embed a panel in your web page displaying your Tweets.
* Twitter provides a method for doing this, using their "Widgets"
* If you have a Twitter account, go to https://twitter.com/settings/widgets - here you can create a new widget which displays a timeline for a certain user. At the end of this process, you're given some HTML and some "minified" JavaScript to paste into your web page. This is the widget for my timeline:

```html
<a class="twitter-timeline" data-dnt="true" href="https://twitter.com/basicallydan" data-widget-id="536476867763916800">Tweets by @basicallydan</a>
<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs");</script>
```
